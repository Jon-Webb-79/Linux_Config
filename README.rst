Arch Linux Installation for Jon Webb!
=====================================
My name is Jon Webb and I am an engineer and scientist that specializes
in Aerospace Engineering, Nuclear Engineering and Computer Science. While
at the office I use whatever computer system my employer requires; however,
at home I prefer to use a computer system with an Arch Linux
Operating System (OS).  Unfortunately Arch Linux can be a daunting OS for 
someone new to Linux, so I am writing this documentation to describe the step
by step process for installing Arch as well as othe programs that are useful
to someone interested in starting a career in Engineering, Data Science,
and Computer Science.

**NOTE:** This installation process is crafted for someone using a UEFI
encrypted hard drive.  While this document describes the process for 
installing Arch Linux, it also has several instructions that are useful
for someone using anothe rLinux distrubition or a Macintosh computer system
